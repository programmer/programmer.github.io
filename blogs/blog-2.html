 <!-- <h1>What is OSAP?</h1> -->

  <p>
    If you’re wondering what the heck is OSAP, you’re not alone! OSAP is the Ontario
    Student Assistance Program, a government financial-aid program that helps
    students pay for university or college.
  </p>

  <p>
    OSAP can help cover many of the major costs that come with going to school. This
    includes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Tuition (the cost of your classes)</li>
    <li>Textbooks and school supplies</li>
    <li>Living expenses (for full-time students)</li>
    <li>Childcare costs (yes, OSAP can help there too!)</li>
    <li>Some disability-related education costs</li>
    <li>Micro-credentials and short programs at approved schools</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    When you apply for OSAP, you are automatically considered for both grants and
    loans.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Grants</strong> = free money you don’t have to pay back</p>
  <p><strong>Loans</strong> = money you do have to pay back later</p>

  <p>
    How much OSAP you receive depends on several factors, including your income,
    your family’s income, your school, your program, whether you live at home or away,
    and your personal circumstances.
  </p>

  <h2>What You Need to Apply</h2>

  <p>To complete your OSAP application, you’ll need a few important documents:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Your Social Insurance Number (SIN)</li>
    <li>
      Your tax information, including T4 slips (and often your parents’ or partner’s
      tax information, depending on your situation)
    </li>
    <li>Your school and program details</li>
    <li>
      Any additional documents OSAP requests (this may include identification,
      disability-related forms, medical information, or proof of income)
    </li>
    <li>Your banking information and direct deposit ready to go</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The application is online and updates each year. It’s a good idea to start early so you
    have time to collect the documents you need as applications take between 4 to 6
    weeks to process. The main deadline for OSAP is 60 days before the end of your
    academic study period. However, each school has their own hard deadline, so make
    sure you check in with your school’s financial aid office.
