<h1>What is OSAP?</h1>
<p>
If you’re wondering what the heck is OSAP, you’re not alone! OSAP is the Ontario Student Assistance Program, a government financial-aid program that helps students pay for university or college.
OSAP can help cover many of the major costs that come with going to school. This includes:
<ul>
   <br>
<li>Tuition (the cost of your classes)</li>
<li>Textbooks and school supplies</li>
<li>Living expenses (for full-time students)</li>
<li>Childcare costs (yes, OSAP can help there too!)</li>
<li>Some disability-related education costs</li>
<li>Micro-credentials and short programs at approved schools</li>
</ul>
  <br>
When you apply for OSAP, you are automatically considered for both grants and loans.
Grants = free money you DON’T have to pay back
Loans = money you DO have to pay back later
How much OSAP you receive depends on several factors, including your income, your family’s income, your school, your program, whether you live at home or away, and your personal circumstances.
 <br>
  <b>What You Need to Apply</b>
   <br>
<ul>
<li>To complete your OSAP application, you’ll need a few important documents:</li>
<li>Your Social Insurance Number (SIN)</li>
<li>Your tax information, including T4 slips (and often your parents’ or partner’s tax information, depending on your situation)</li>
<li>Your school and program details</li>
<li>Any additional documents OSAP requests (this may include identification, disability-related forms, medical information, or proof of income)</li>
<li>Your banking information and direct deposit ready to go</li>
</ul>
   <br>
The application is online and updates each year. It’s a good idea to start early so you have time to collect the documents you need as applications take between 4 to 6 weeks to process. The main deadline for OSAP is 60 days before the end of your academic study period. However, each school has their own hard deadline, so make sure you check in with your school’s financial aid office.
 <br>
  <b>Supports for Indigenous Students </b>
 <br>
  OSAP also connects students to financial supports designed for Indigenous learners, including:
Indigenous-specific bursaries
Métis Nation of Ontario education and training programs
Ontario First Generation Bursary (if your parents did not attend postsecondary school)
You can learn more about OSAP for under-represented learners here.
   <br>
<b>Supports for Students From Extended Society Care</b>
 <br>
  Extended society care is when a child or youth is legally looked after by a children’s aid society (CAS) because they cannot safely live with their parents or guardians. If you are currently or were formerly in extended society care (sometimes called “crown wardship”), you may be able to have your application fees refunded for approved college, university, or Indigenous Institute programs. This applies no matter your age, income, or adoption status.
 <br>
  <b>Supports for Students With Disabilities</b>
 <br>
  If you have a permanent disability or a persistent or prolonged disability, you may qualify for full-time OSAP while taking 40% or more of a full course load. You must self-identify as having a disability in your OSAP application to access this support. If you are Deaf and want to study at a school where American Sign Language or Québec Sign Language is the main language of instruction (including outside Canada), a special bursary may help you with the additional costs.
