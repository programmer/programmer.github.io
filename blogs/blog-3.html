<h1>What If You’re an Immigrant and Need OSAP?</h1>
<article class="blog-post" id="immigrant-osap">
  <!-- <h1>What If You’re an Immigrant and Need OSAP?</h1> -->

  <p>
    If you’re new to Canada and hoping to go to college or university, OSAP can be a
    huge help, but only certain immigration statuses qualify. Here’s a simple breakdown.
  </p>

  <p>To receive OSAP, you must be one of the following:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Canadian Citizen</strong><br>
      Most refugee youth won’t fall here.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Permanent Resident (PR)</strong><br>
      You’d need a PR card issued by the Government of Canada. However, many
      youths don’t have this yet because the process takes time.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Protected Person / Convention Refugee</strong><br>
      This is where most newcomer youth experiencing homelessness qualify.
      You’re considered a Protected Person if Canada has officially recognized that
      returning to your home country would put you at risk of violence, torture, or
      serious harm.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>To be recognized as a Protected Person, OSAP accepts one of these documents:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Verification of Status from IRCC</li>
    <li>Notice of Decision from the Immigration and Refugee Board</li>
    <li>Protected Persons Status Document (issued before Jan 1, 2013)</li>
    <li>Refugee Travel Document</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Documents You’ll Need Before Applying</h2>

  <p>Even if you’re eligible, OSAP requires certain documents:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>A Social Insurance Number (SIN):</strong><br>
      If you don’t have one yet, you can apply for a temporary SIN starting with “9.”
      Once you become a permanent resident, you can change it to a permanent
      SIN. To get one, send a request using Service Canada’s e-service request
      form.
    </li>
    <li>
      One of the Protected Person documents listed above (Verification of Status,
      Notice of Decision, etc.)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>If You’re an Immigrant Experiencing Homelessness</h2>

  <p>
    You can still apply for OSAP. You do not need a permanent address, and your
    school’s financial aid office can help you submit documents, explain your housing
    situation, or adjust information if you don’t have parental support.
  </p>

  <h2>Who is Not Eligible?</h2>

  <p>You cannot get OSAP if you are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>An international student studying on a study permit</li>
    <li>A refugee claimant whose case hasn’t been decided yet</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>If You’re a Refugee Experiencing Homelessness</h2>

  <p>
    Not having a permanent address does not prevent you from applying for OSAP. Your
    school’s financial aid office can help explain your situation on your application,
    submit documents, or assist if you cannot provide parental information. Remember,
    OSAP considers living expenses. OSAP funding is intended to cover educational
    costs and basic living expenses, which can include shelter, residence fees, and
    books. Students who are homeless or have a low income may be eligible for
    additional aid.
  </p>

  <h2>Social Assistance Options</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Ontario Works (OW):</strong> Homeless individuals can apply for OW in the
      geographic area where they intend to live. OW provides temporary financial
      support for basic needs and shelter, which can be up to approximately $733
      per month for a single person.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Combining OW/ODSP and OSAP:</strong> Students can receive both OSAP and
      social assistance concurrently under certain circumstances. Students
      receiving Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) income support, for
      example, have a 100% exemption on income earned (including OSAP grants)
      while enrolled in full-time studies, allowing them to potentially receive both.
      It is important to report any social assistance received on your OSAP
      application and inform your caseworker about any OSAP you receive.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Where to Find Help</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>School Financial Aid Office:</strong> Can help explain eligibility, and if you’re a
      refugee claimant (not eligible for OSAP), they can direct you to internal
      bursaries.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Settlement.org:</strong> Information for newcomers on financial aid and education.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Windmill Microlending:</strong> Low-interest loans (up to $15,000) for immigrants
      who may not qualify for OSAP.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Emergency Assistance (Ontario):</strong> One-time help with urgent housing or
      food needs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Youth Without Shelter:</strong> Support, housing programs, and resources for
      youth experiencing homelessness.
    </li>
  </ul>
