  <p>
    Point A is your starting place. We are an accessible, youth-focused resource hub
    designed by York University students to help you get from Point A to Point B, C, and
    beyond in your education and career.
  </p>

  <p>
    We know that finding clear information, especially about OSAP, financial aid, or job
    opportunities is difficult. Government websites are confusing. Tutorials can be
    lengthy and boring. And most existing resources were not built with the young people
    navigating them in mind. So, we created something different.
  </p>

  <p>
    Point A exists to make navigating adulthood easier, including those experiencing
    homelessness in all its forms: hidden, couch-surfing, or even shelter-involved. We
    provide:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Straightforward written guides to help you understand important processes</li>
    <li>Video tutorials that do not put you to sleep</li>
    <li>Youth-built resources, all in one place</li>
    <li>Support that meets you where you’re at</li>
  </ul>
