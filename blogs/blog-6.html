<h1>Apprenticeship and Entrepreneurship</h1>
<article class="blog-post" id="apprenticeship-entrepreneurship">


  <p>
    If college and university aren’t for you, there are other options. Some jobs are
    considered trades, such as cosmetology or woodworking. For these, you would take
    an apprenticeship instead of a regular school. An apprenticeship is a type of training
    you do under the supervision of someone else in order to learn how to do a certain
    kind of specialized skill.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Start an Apprenticeship</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Gather information:</strong>
      <p>
        Some jobs are compulsory trades, which means you must get a certification in
        order to work in this job. For this, you must get an apprenticeship. Other jobs
        are voluntary trades. This means that an apprenticeship is not required, but it
        may help you gain the skills you need to work.
      </p>
      <p>Here are some websites that will tell you which jobs need apprenticeships or not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Skilled Trades Ontario:</strong> This is the website for the skilled trades board
          of Ontario. On their “Apprenticeship” website, you can search different
          jobs and find the requirements needed to work in each one. You can
          also see the average salary and amount of demand for the jobs, to help
          you determine if these jobs are sustainable long-term.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ontario Job Bank:</strong> This is a frequently-updated list of jobs offered by
          the government in Ontario. This includes jobs that require different
          types of education, including apprenticeship. You can use this website
          to see what kinds of careers are available in Ontario, as the jobs
          posted by the government are often considered stable.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Find a mentor / employer sponsor:</strong>
      <p>
        To start an apprenticeship you need to find either a mentor, or an employer
        sponsor. Normally, this is an employer. When applying to a skilled trade job,
        ask the employer if they are willing to act as your sponsor.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Register for an apprenticeship program:</strong>
      <p>
        Once you have found a sponsor or mentor, you will both have to sign a training
        agreement with Skilled Trades Ontario. This agreement must then be registered
        with the Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development. Your
        sponsor will likely have information on how to do this. If not, you can always
        revisit the Skilled Trades Ontario website to learn more. After this, you are
        officially an apprentice!
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Complete your apprenticeship training:</strong>
      <p>
        To complete the apprenticeship program, you normally have to finish two
        requirements: on-the-job hours (paid work with your sponsor or mentor), and
        in-school training. This training in school is normally at either a local community
        college or at special training centres, depending on the trade. It is not like a
        traditional classroom setting: you will learn practical skills that are essential to
        the career you have chosen. It will directly relate to the experience you will gain
        in your on-the-job training.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Obtain certification:</strong>
      <p>
        After finishing all of your work hours and schooling, you receive a Certificate of
        Apprenticeship. This is enough for some careers to begin working
        independently, if the career is a voluntary trade.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Get your license:</strong>
      <p>
        For compulsory trades, you might need to write an exam to obtain a license. This
        license will allow you to work without a supervisor. You might need to pass a
        Certificate of Qualification exam in order to obtain a License from Skilled Trades
        Ontario.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    This training will often cost money, just like traditional school. There are some grants
    that exist for apprentice students, as well as OSAP for the in-school training portion
    of an apprenticeship. For example, the Tools Grant is a cash grant that covers the
    tools you might need to buy for your apprenticeship. Different apprenticeships offer
    different amounts of money, so check how much you are eligible for.
  </p>

  <h2>Entrepreneurship</h2>

  <p>
    If you have a skill or service that will not need a license or apprenticeship, such as
    baking or website design, then you might want to start your own business.
    Entrepreneurship means starting your own business, one that you own and operate
    yourself without a boss.
  </p>

  <p>Here are some steps you might have to take when starting your business:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Decide on your business:</strong>
      <p>
        You need to develop a clear idea of what you will be selling. What sort of service
        will you provide? Is there demand for it? Are you able to provide a good enough
        quality service that other people will want to buy it?
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Business plan:</strong>
      <p>
        A business plan is a plan that tracks exactly how your business will work. This is
        things such as what your business is selling, how you will make these things that
        you sell, and how you plan to sell them to customers. You should have a clear
        idea of how these things will work before you begin to find customers.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Register your business:</strong>
      <p>
        You will have to register your business with the Province of Ontario. This means
        that the province will recognize your business as legitimate, or real. There are
        various kinds of licensing available depending on who you are working with and
        who will own the business with you, so make sure you research all the options
        before choosing the best one.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Licensing:</strong>
      <p>
        Some kinds of businesses will require a special license to operate. For example,
        businesses who sell any kind of food will need a Food Handler Certification.
        Make sure you research what kind of license your business might need
        depending on what kind of product or service it sells.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Banking Accounts:</strong>
      <p>You will need to set up a few different bank accounts for your business. You might need:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>A credit account:</strong> a line of money you borrow from the bank to make
          big purchases, that you must pay back.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Business account:</strong> a place to keep the money you earn and save for
          your business.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Merchant account:</strong> a bank account your business will use to handle
          transactions (payments between customers and you).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Marketing:</strong>
      <p>
        Marketing means promoting your products to potential new customers. This is
        how you can spread the word about your business to new people. Social media,
        such as Tiktok, Instagram, or Facebook, are great ways of promoting your
        products and services online for free.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Additional Points:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Check Municipal Licensing Requirements:</strong> Some municipalities
          (cities) will require a license on top of the provincial business license.
          Check with your city to see if your business needs a license or not.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Register for CRA Accounts (If Needed):</strong> The CRA is the Canadian
          Revenue Agency. They handle all taxes, which is an amount of money
          the government must take away from any income. If you’re hiring
          employees, or doing international trading, you might want to register for
          an account with the CRA to help you handle taxing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Obtain Insurance:</strong> Insurance is something you pay monthly or
          annually (every year). If your business ever has a crisis such as a major
          accident or loss, insurance helps you pay for the damage. This is not
          always required, but it is a major help in times of need.
