<h1>OSAP and Dependants</h1>
<article class="blog-post" id="osap-dependants">

  <p>OSAP has two different types of applicants:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Dependants</strong> are people that are being supported by a parent or guardian.
      This means they are either living with them, or being supported financially by
      them (the parents or guardians may give them money every month to help
      them with their living costs).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Independents</strong> are people who are not married or in a common-law
      relationship (a couple that has lived together for 3 or more years, or 1 if they
      have a child together), and fall under one of these categories:
      <ol>
        <li>
          You’ve been out of high school for 6 or more years (when they’re
          considering how much money you can get from the provincial
          government), or 4 or more years (when they’re considering how much
          money you can get from the federal government).
        </li>
        <li>You’ve worked full-time for 24 months in a row.</li>
        <li>Both of your parents are deceased.</li>
        <li>
          You’re a youth in or from extended society care, or you were in the
          custody of the government before you were 18.
        </li>
        <li>
          You’re still receiving a Continued Care and Support for Youth
          allowance from a Children’s Aid Society.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Often, youth experiencing homelessness lack stable family support, so if you do not
    live with your parents, and you’re separated from them due to health or safety
    concerns (which you must explain on your application), and at least one scenario
    from both categories applies to you, OSAP will consider you an independent. As an
    independent, OSAP looks at your income only. So if you’re experiencing
    homelessness, this category exists to make sure that you can receive the necessary
    funding to pursue a higher education.
  </p>

  <p>
    Make sure you know which category you qualify for! OSAP is there to help
    everybody pursue further education, no matter your family background.
