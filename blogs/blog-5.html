  <p>
    A scholarship is free money from an organization to help you pay for school. This
    can be anywhere from a small amount (such as $250) up to the entire cost of your
    tuition. Most of the time, scholarships are given to people either based on academic
    achievement (how well you have done in previous schooling), or financial need (how
    much you need money based on your family or personal situation). For financial
    need, this can include everything from race, gender, nationality, religion, disability,
    income, or family situation.

    Hundreds of scholarships go unclaimed every year, so it is always worth applying if
    you believe you qualify for them! Here is a list of places you can find and apply for
